# weather-website
This is a weather website which takes in user input of a city from anywhere in the world. Then, using OpenWeatherMap Weather API, it fetches the data of the city's weather. This includes the current temperature in the city, what the temperature feels like, the percentage of humidity, a description of the weather, and an image to go along with it.
